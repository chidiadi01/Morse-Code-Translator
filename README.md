# Morse-Code-Translator
This is my first Swing project. It translates from English to Morse Code and from Morse Code to English Language. It also has the ability to save your Morse code to a file and to read through file and translate I directly back to English. And while translating back to English, it recognises sentences -- though not too excellently, but it capitalised first words after periods.

You can get the jar file at `out/artifacts/MorseCodeTranslator_jar`. Please run it an give me feedback.
