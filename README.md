# Morse-Code-Translator

This is my first Swing project. It is a simple GUI app that translates from English to Morse Code and vice versa. It also allows you to save your Morse Code to text files and translate Morse Code directly from text files.

If you don't know what Morse Code is, it was used back in the days with telegraphs. It uses a system of dots and dashes to encode messages character by character. You can read more about it [here.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_code)

My app also recognises sentences, though not too excellently yet. It capitalises first words in a sentence. Doesn't yet recognise URLs but I'll work on that. You're free to fork this repository and create your pull requests. You're also free to add issues.

You can find the executable JAR file at `out/artifacts/MorseCodeTranslator_jar`. Please run it and give me feedback. Thanks.

PS: Don't forget to star my codeðŸ˜Š
